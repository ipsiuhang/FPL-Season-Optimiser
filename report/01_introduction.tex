\section{Introduction}

Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is a popular online game where participants manage 
virtual football teams by selecting real Premier League players under budget and 
compositional constraints, earning points based on actual match performances. This 
project formalizes FPL team management as a discrete optimization problem and 
develops open-source tools for systematic decision-making.

The core challenge combines multiple constraint categories: selecting 15 players 
within £100 million, satisfying positional quotas and formation rules, limiting 
club affiliations, and managing weekly transfers with penalty costs. The project 
implements this optimization using both Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) 
and Constraint Programming (CP) paradigms with multiple solver backends.

For this study, data from three sources was integrated and cleaned to create a 
comprehensive 2024-25 season dataset. The deliverables include team optimizers 
(MILP via PuLP and CP via MiniZinc), backtesting infrastructure validating 
decisions against actual season outcomes, and the cleaned dataset. The complete 
implementation is publicly available at
